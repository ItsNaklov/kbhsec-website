#  **KbhSec Code of Conduct**

We’re building a community for learning, sharing, and connecting. To keep it welcoming and enjoyable for everyone, we expect all participants to follow this Code of Conduct.

<br/><br/>

##  **PURPOSE**

\- Create a constructive, inclusive, and positive atmosphere at all our events.  
      
\- Provide a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, identity, orientation, disability, appearance, body size, race, religion, or background.  
      
\- Make sure everyone knows what behavior they can expect from others, and what’s expected of them.  
    

<br/><br/>

##  **RESPECT FOR OTHERS**

All participants will:

\- Treat others with respect, kindness, and fairness.  
      
\- Allow space for others to speak and be heard.  
      
\- Value different perspectives, even if they’re not your own.  
      
\- Treat organizers, volunteers, speakers, and venues with respect.  
    

Harassment, discrimination, or disruptive behavior won’t be tolerated. Organizers may ask anyone who violates these principles to leave an event.

<br/><br/>

## **EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES**

\- Everyone deserves to feel safe and welcome.  
      
\- Bullying, harassment, or discrimination of any kind is not acceptable.  
    
<br/><br/>

##  **REPORTING**

If you experience or witness behavior that goes against this Code of Conduct, please let an organizer or volunteer know. We’ll handle all reports promptly, respectfully, and confidentially.

<br/><br/>

##  **ENFORCEMENT**

The organizers and board reserve the right to determine what constitutes unacceptable behavior. Participation in our community is a privilege, and we may restrict attendance or membership if this Code of Conduct is violated.
